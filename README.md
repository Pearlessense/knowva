## ✧ about knowva.lol
i’ve seen a lot of discord bots that only focus on moderation or fun commands, but not many that lean into **automation**. knowva aims to be a multi-tool use assistant for discord.
- handling tasks, streamlining workflows, and making servers more productive.

**here's why you should consider giving it a try:**
* user installation allows you to use slash commands from **anywhere** in discord, even in dms.
* **automation-first design** means you can set reminders, schedule messages, and run utilities without clutter.
* completely **free** to use, with optional premium perks for advanced features.
